         <p>Mitali Nopany was born on 10th October 1996, in Mumbai, India. She lives with her parents, elder sister and younger brother. She studied in BD Somani International School till grade 9 and then in 2011 moved to Baroda in Gujrat. Her interest in art started growing and she decided to make it her career.</p>
         <p>Currently she is studying Communication Design in Parsons School for Design in New York City. She is interested in making a future in advertising. She is experiencing a thrilling, fast paced life, which is a massive transition from the eighteen years that she has spent in this small city. Being from a conservative Indian family, her future ventures are yet unclear. She will either become a homemaker just like her mother or will get to live and breathe her passion of being a designer. Parsons is giving her the opportunity to be exposed to fervent and determined individuals, who, just like her are set out to leave their mark on the world.</p>
